  title: "Grocery Shopping: Supermarkets & Markets",
  content: `
    Living in the UK as a student means I have to cook for myself, so I usually do my [weekly shop] on Saturdays. Since I’m [on a tight budget], I try to be smart about where I buy my food.

    For basics like milk, bread, and meat, I go to big supermarkets like Tesco or Lidl. I grab a trolley or a basket at the entrance and start walking down the [aisles]. I always check the ["reduced to clear" section] first — these are items with yellow stickers that are expiring soon but are much cheaper. It’s a great way to [save a few pounds].
    
    When I’m done, I usually go to the [self-checkout] machines. I scan the barcodes myself, pack my items into my backpack, and pay using my phone. Everyone here uses [contactless payment]; it’s so fast and convenient.

    However, for fruit and vegetables, I prefer the local [street market]. The atmosphere there is completely different. It’s loud, lively, and often crowded. The stall owners shout out prices like "One pound a bowl!", which is a real [bargain] compared to the supermarket prices.

    The [fresh produce] at the market is usually better quality too, but there’s a catch: most stalls only accept cash. So, I always have to remember to [withdraw some cash] before I go. I walk around, pick the best-looking vegetables, and pay the vendor.

    By the time I finish, my bags are usually [heavy and packed full]. The walk home can be tiring, but once I get back and [stock up the fridge], I feel really satisfied knowing I have enough food for the whole week.
