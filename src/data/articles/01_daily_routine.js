  title: "A Typical Day in the UK",
  content: `
    I usually start my day by waking up, [getting out of bed], and [throwing on] some clothes. Then I [head to] the kitchen to make my breakfast. I normally fry two eggs and [spread peanut butter on] four slices of bread. Once the eggs are ready, I put them between the slices to make a sandwich. Then I [warm up] some milk in the microwave and enjoy my breakfast quietly before the day gets busy.

    After eating, I [tidy up a bit] and [pack my laptop] and everything I need for school. I grab my bag, put on my coat and shoes, lock the door, and [head out]. I walk to the train station — it’s right inside the university, which is really convenient. I [catch the train] to class; it’s only one stop. Once I arrive on campus, I walk to my classroom and [get ready for] the lecture.

    All my classes are taught entirely in English, so I have to [concentrate quite hard]. At first, I [struggled to keep up], especially when the teacher spoke fast. But after a few weeks, I [got used to] the pace. Even if I miss a few words, I can still understand the main idea.

    At lunchtime, I don’t go to the canteen because it’s expensive. Instead, I bring my own lunch. At school, I just [pop it into] the microwave, [heat it up], and [find a quiet place] to eat. It’s healthier, cheaper, and honestly, much tastier.

    After lunch, I usually go outside to [get some sun]. I always feel a bit sleepy after eating, so standing outside helps [clear my head]. Once I feel awake again, I head to the library. The atmosphere helps me [stay focused] because everyone around me is working hard.

    When I’m [done studying], I [pack up] and go to the train station. The train is often [delayed or cancelled], so sometimes I wait longer than expected. Once I get home, I [take a short nap] to [recharge] before my part-time job.

    After work, I come home, [relax for a bit], and then make dinner. After dinner, I [take a warm shower] to [unwind]. Sometimes I [lose track of time] while coding. Finally, I [switch off the lights] and fall asleep.
